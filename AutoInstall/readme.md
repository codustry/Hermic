# silent install the dependency, VBAudio

> This feature was coded by Nutchanon Ninyawee.

Hermic client requires an dependency driver, VBAudio. Our team think that it would be nice if users does not need to install by themselves, so I coded this automation installing. This would be a part of the client installer at the end.

Using Autohotkey scripting language, I able to automate the installation of VBAudio.
