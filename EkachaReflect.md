# Overall
All of the document works has been done before the Songkran day. Everything has been great. We seperate the work by how hard of the work equally. Even sometime I write the document very confused. (Hope it is not going to happen on this again LoL).

## Harit Chokthananuchit (Jack) 57070503403
From me Jack is a helpful guy, he always asks me that “Do you need some helps ?”. Even he did not finish his work yet. And he is very good in English than the other members on this group. However, he working quite slower than the other members on this group. The reason is his personality, so the work from him is slower than others.

## Nutchanon Ninyawee (Ben) 57070503410
From my opinion, he is a leader of our group. He already plans every work tasks on his mind then he will consider which task or work are suitable for each person. For example Ben will give the task about documentation, diagram, and easily code to me. Because my coding skill quite not good as other members in this group.
Ben is a person that I can ask for a suggestion because he is a person that can explain every detailed that I missing on the work or diagram even the code I get a bug/problem he can explain which part I need to add/edit/remove.
