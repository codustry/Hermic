# Overall
In the documentation work, three of us met up daily since the end of March to get more work done more and more each day. We got the documentation done one day before Songkran. (which was awesome)

# To Nutchanon Ninyawee, Ben
Ben is a leader in our group. He has a clear vision about the project in his mind. He wants the work to be perfect. He always tells us to care every detail. When I or Pooh have any problems, he will always be there to help us out.
# To Ekacha Techasuknirun, Pooh
He is a good entertainer in our group. When things get hard, he would try to make us laugh with his weird jokes.(that make us get headaches)
He is a professional in creating diagrams. He loves helping people even he had hard time in his coding.
