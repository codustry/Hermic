# Hermic

## Browsing thru impremented features
you can see details of each part by clicking the folder on the github repo, or by open the .md file
1. iPhone App
2. VBCable Driver autoinstall script
3. Hermic system trayicon

We also have members' reflections for each people from each person in this team. The reflections wrote in .md at the root of this repo.

## Hermic is what?

Your smartphone is already an industry-standard microphone device with noise cancellation. There is no reason to buy another equipment of the same type. Thus we introduced and developed this solution, *Hermic*.

*Hermic* has 2 parts. One is the iOS application and two is the windows client running in the background. Both communicates by USB connection. The below are some principles we focused.

## Philosophy
### Fail-safe to unexpected detach USB cable
Users can detach/attach the USB connection anytime without experience crash or error.
### Fully customized settings for sound quality/battery life
Users should be able to decide quality of sound they want. Sometimes, usersâ€™ devices run with limited battery. In some cases, users might need to trade off sound quality with longer operational time.
### Minimal UI/UX design
We try to minimize the learning curve. Users could master this app after a few tap.

## Implementation and testing phase responsibilities
 The implementation and testing started ion June 14th, 2017 and continued until June 21st, 2017. The task of work will explain with the table below this, which it include what we were done as well as who completed that task.

## IMPLEMENTATION & TESTING - MAJOR PROBLEMS
In the implementation process, most problems we have faced is that we were new to the tasks that each of us are assigned to. To create and iOS application, some of us had to learn how to code in swift. To create Windows software interfaces, some of us had to learn python from nothing. It was quite hard to learn a completely new language with the limited time. To complete this project, we needed to integrate different knowledges together which also took some time to get it done.

In testing process, there was not many problems. On both iOS app and PC testing. It was very straight forward. The thing that we can improve is to have more test cases as much as possible to get bugs out.
