## Hermic is what?

Your smartphone is already an industry-standard microphone device with noise cancellation. There is no reason to buy another equipment of the same type. Thus we introduced and developed this solution, *Hermic*.

*Hermic* has 2 parts. One is the iOS application and two is the windows client running in the background. Both communicates by USB connection. The below are some principles we focused.

## Philosophy
### Fail-safe to unexpected detach USB cable
Users can detach/attach the USB connection anytime without experience crash or error.
### Fully customized settings for sound quality/battery life
Users should be able to decide quality of sound they want. Sometimes, usersâ€™ devices run with limited battery. In some cases, users might need to trade off sound quality with longer operational time.
### Minimal UI/UX design
We try to minimize the learning curve. Users could master this app after a few tap.

## Implementation and testing phase responsibilities
 The implementation and testing started ion June 14th, 2017 and continued until June 21st, 2017. The task of work will explain with the table below this, which it include what we were done as well as who completed that task.
