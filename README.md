# Hermic
## Hermic is

Your smartphone is already an industry-standard microphone device with noise cancellation. There is no reason to buy another equipment of the same type. Thus we introduced and developed this solution, *Hermic*.

*Hermic* has 2 parts. One is the iOS application and two is the windows client running in the background. Both communicates by USB connection. The below are some principles we focused.
### Fail-safe to unexpected detach USB cable
Users can detach/attach the USB connection anytime without experience crash or error.
### Fully customized settings for sound quality/battery life
Users should be able to decide quality of sound they want. Sometimes, usersâ€™ devices run with limited battery. In some cases, users might need to trade off sound quality with longer operational time.
### Minimal UI/UX design
We try to minimize the learning curve. Users could master this app after a few tap.
